> "As the Supreme Court explained in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., “Parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim’s (or collective victims’) imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing.”" - Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. _(2 Live Crew v Roy Orbison)_

#### Weird Al

> And yes, Weird Al Yankovic sort of ruined it for all song parodists by never picking fights with those whose songs he parodies by giving those songwrighter _all_ of the publishing copyright on the parodies he performs. So even though he writes his own lyrics to their famous songs, he doesn't claim any ownership interest in those songs. And as my colleague notes, his lyrics do comment directly on the song itself and/or on its songwriter, which would greatly increase his odds of winning a parody argument, if he ever engaged in one. - Pamela Koslyn
