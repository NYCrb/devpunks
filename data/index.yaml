mission: >
  Devpunks include a diverse array of ideologies, fashions and forms of
  expression, including visual art, literature, and film. Devpunk are largely
  characterized by **anti-establishment** views and the promotion of
  **individual freedom**. The devpunk is centered on a loud, aggressive genre
  of developers. It is usually played by small teams consisting of a junior,
  one or two seniors, and a hiring manager.

politics: >
  devpunk politics cover the entire political spectrum. devpunk-related
  ideologies are mostly concerned with individual freedom and
  anti-establishment views. Common devpunk viewpoints include
  anti-authoritarianism, a DIY ethic, non-conformity, direct action and not
  selling out.

community: >
  devpunks can come from any and all walks of life and economic classes.
  Compared to some alternative cultures, devpunk is much closer to being gender
  equalist in terms of its ideology.

  One part of devpunk is creating explicitly outward identities of mentality.
  Everything that was normally supposed to be hidden was brought to the front,
  both literally and figuratively.

media: >
  Devpunks often follow a DIY policy of filming the footage first, without
  permission, and also posting it without permission, but will generally take
  down material if asked. Founder Joly MacFie argues that this serves an
  important archival purpose.

  Devpunk Communities use collaborative podcasts &amp; vocasts to support
  multiple contributors podcasting through generally simplified processes, and
  without having to host their own individual feeds. A community podcast can
  also allow members of the community (related to the podcast topic) to
  contribute to the podcast in many different ways. This method was first used
  for a series of podcasts hosted by the Regional Educational Technology Center
  at Fordham University in 2005.
