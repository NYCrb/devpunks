Since you’ve been here …
… some things have changed. Whilst advertising revenues across the media are still falling fast, more people are helping to fund The DevPunks’s independent, investigative journalism than ever. Which means we now stand a fighting chance. But we still need your help.

The DevPunks is editorially independent. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important because it enables us to give a voice to the voiceless, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. We keep our factual, honest reporting open to all, not just for those who can afford it. And we want to keep it that way, for generations to come.

If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure. For as little as $1, you can support the DevPunks – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.
